# Pokemon Go API for Python

This was originally based on tejado's **original** demo,
[this API](https://github.com/tejado/pgoapi/tree/eb788ebbde46664013527a2e5f6c16e98d59d5e3/old-demo).
You can view this as an advanced
and cleaned up version
based on object-oriented principles.

Additions welcome.

# Current implementation
Our current implementaion covers most of the basics of gameplay. The following methods are availible:

```
# Get profile
def getProfile(self):

# Get Location
def getMapObjects(self, radius=10):

# Spin a pokestop
def getFortSearch(self, fort):

# Get encounter
def encounterPokemon(self, pokemon):

# Upon Encounter, try and catch
def catchPokemon(self, pokemon, pokeball=1):

# Evolve Pokemon
def evolvePokemon(self, pokemon):

# Transfer Pokemon
def releasePokemon(self, pokemon):

# Throw away items
def recycleItem(self, item_id, count):

# set an Egg into an incubator
def setEgg(self, item, pokemon):

# Get Eggs
def getEggs(self):

# Get Inventory
def getInventory(self):

# Get Badges
def getBadges(self):

# Get Settings
def getDownloadSettings(self):
```
Every method has been tested. Pull requests are encouraged.

## Demo
`demo.py` includes a demo of the API.

```
âžœ  python demo.py -a "google" -u "email@gmail.com" -p "thepassword" -l "The Atlantic Ocean"

This is achieved with minimal coding effort on the client's part
(extract from `demo.py`):

```
  # ... Blabla define the parser
  if args.auth == 'ptc':
      session = api.createPTCSession(args.username, args.password, args.location)
  elif args.auth == 'google':
      session = api.createGoogleSession(args.username, args.password, args.location)

  if session: # do stuff
      profile = session.getProfile()
      logging.info(profile)
```

## Contribution
Hell yeah!
I'm on [Slack](https://pkre.slack.com) too
(want an [invite](https://shielded-earth-81203.herokuapp.com)?)
if you want to have a quick chat.

I welcome all PRs but for big changes it'd be best
to open an issue so I have some idea of what's going on.
This thing is under heavy development after all.

## Protocol
We currently use [AeonLucid's Pokemon Go Protobuf protocol](https://github.com/AeonLucid/POGOProtos).
